# Replication materials for "Identification, Interpretability, and Bayesian Word Embeddings"

These require the `bwe` package, available [here](https://github.com/adamlauretig/bwe). There are two subfolders in this repo, one of which contains the materials to replicate the inaugural analysis, the other contains the material to replicate the *Foreign Relations of the United States* analysis. I included the embedding model results as well as the data used to fit the model, in case results vary across architectures.
